# Clark Public Utilities Vector Symbols

I created SVG-versions of some of our electric network symbology for (future) use in our GIS and webmaps. 

ArcMap doesn't currently (as of 10.2) support using SVGs for symbology directly, however they do support EMFs (Enhanced Meta Format) which SVGs can be converted to. Unfortunately, offset + rotation doesn't behave the same for picture markers as for character markers, so some of the symbols (Overhead Transformers for example) won't be viable even in EMF.
